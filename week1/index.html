            Until now, it was difficult for me to have a clear idea of being
            able to use an array to make a list of all the tasks and notes that
            we are going to have in this class, I really liked thinking about
            how to develop this activity. I was able to investigate many ways
            that the vast majority were stressful by not having an optimal
            result. In most of the tests I had the difficulty of listing the
            contents of the arrays one by one. I used for methods, functions,
            foreach methods, but I didn't get the result until I used .map.

            Three tools that will be used for this semester in web development n
            Â° 2 will be: HTML, CSS and Java Script with the help of text editors
            such as VS Code. A very important tool for project storage is
            Github, which will help us create our portfolio in the cloud and we
            can create a link directly so that others can see it as a web page,
            fortunately this tool gives us a free address for the project .

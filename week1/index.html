                    Until now, it was difficult for me to have a clear idea of being able to use an array to make a list of all the tasks and notes that we are going to have in this class, I really liked thinking about how to develop this activity. I was able to investigate many ways that the vast majority were stressful by not having an optimal result. In most of the tests I had the difficulty of listing the contents of the arrays one by one. I used for methods, functions, foreach methods, but I didn't get the result until I used .map.

                    Until now, it was difficult for me to have a clear idea of being able to use an array to make a list of
                     all the tasks and notes that we are going to have in this class, I really liked thinking about how to 
                     develop this activity. I was able to investigate many ways that the vast majority were stressful by not 
                     having an optimal result. In most of the tests I had the difficulty of listing the contents of the arrays 
                     one by one. I used for methods, functions, foreach methods, but I didn't get the result until I used .map.

                    Three tools that will be used for this semester in web development n Â° 2 will be:
HTML, CSS and Java Script with the help of text editors such as VS Code.
A very important tool for project storage is Github, which will help us create our portfolio in the cloud and we can create a link directly so that others can see it as a web page, fortunately this tool gives us a free address for the project .

                <h3>Basic programming:</h3>
                Comments-> We use comments as non-executable code, that means it won't alter the functionality of our program. Comments help us to label our code and know what it does, that will help us find and understand the code easily when an error occurs.
                JavaScript Grammar-As a main part of the programming language is recognizing that every statement you write must end with ; since that signals the end of the statement.
                Each language has a list of reserved words which we cannot use freely, the purpose of these reserved words is that they can store special instructions or help for our use within our code.
                Variables->
                We have three ways to call variables with their reserved words which are LET, CONST, VAR. These three ways of declaring variables have their different purposes. The most important thing is to know that VAR is more different than LET and CONST .
                Among the type of variables that we can use in JavaScript programming we have: symbols, numbers, characters, null, undefined, boolean, logical, strings.
                Arrays are groups of data that help us store and order information that we can access through Loops.
                Loops are some types to access, such as for, while, do while, map loops.
                Arrays have different methods to be able to modify the lists, we can add, delete, change, move the information within an Array
                
                In object-oriented programming we have a tool to be able to store specific processes, which will help us to order our codes and reuse our codes.
